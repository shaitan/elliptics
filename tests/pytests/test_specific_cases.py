        These test case check correct handling situation when some backend from one nodes has the same group and ids
        like another backend from another node.
        For this test all nodes mustn't know about each other, their `remote` are empty.
        In this test creates 2 client nodes and both connects to 2 different nodes.
        At each node selects one backend from one group, equal to both backend.
        Updates ids for both backends to make it be equal.
        To the second client node adds remote to the first node.
        It raises route-list update error: -EEXIST and raises exception.
        After that makes read some nonexistent key from all groups - it will raise an exception.
        With old bug this test case caused `Segmentation fault` on read_data_from_groups.
        At the end reverts ids of both backends.
