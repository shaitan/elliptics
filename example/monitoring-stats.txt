## Measuring points

io.cmd
    time of commands, overall for entire command stream of the node

io.cmd.{<any elliptics command type in upper case>}
    time of commands for each type

io.cmd.{<any elliptics command type in upper case>}.lock_time
    time spent in id lock waiting, for each command type,
    (this will be 0 for commands with DNET_FLAGS_NOLOCK flag set)

io.cmd_recursive
    time of commands that originate from other commands execution, overall for entire elliptics command stream
    (right now only BULK_READ generate subcommands like that)

io.cmd_recursive.READ
    time of READs that originate from BULK_READ commands

cache.{READ,WRITE,DEL}
    time spent in cache layer, for listed command types

eblob_backend.cmd.{READ,WRITE,LOOKUP,DEL,READ_RANGE,DEL_RANGE}
    time spent in eblob backend layer, for listed command types

io.notify.update
    time of sending notification to registered target

io.notify.{add,remove}
    time of adding or removing notification target

io.cmds
    tracks all input commands that processed by this node

io.forwards
    tracks all input commands that forwarded to other node

io.replies
    tracks all input commands that are really replies (has DNET_FLAGS_REPLY flag set)

io.input.queue.size
    tracks size of virtual input queue of the node

io.output.queue.size
    tracks instant size of output queue of the node

pool.{sys,<backend id>}.{blocking,nonblocking}.queue.size
    tracks size of a pool's input queue

pool.{sys,<backend id>}.{blocking,nonblocking}.queue.wait_time
    time commands spent waiting in a pool's input queue

pool.{sys,<backend id>}.{blocking,nonblocking}.active_threads
    tracks pool's thread utilization (how many threads are actually working)
